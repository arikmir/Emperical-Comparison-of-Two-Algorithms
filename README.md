# Emperical-Comparison-of-Two-Algorithms

**Emperical Comparision between 2 algorithms called MinDistance & MinDistance2 algorithms**

**Project by ARIK INTENAM MIR, for CAB301 - QUT**
- **Codes are in C#**. 
- **Report Included**


 **Project Summary**
 
This focus of this project is to analyze and compare two distinct algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Though these algorithms differ in efficiency, the task of both of these algorithms are same, they both find out the minimum distance between two elements in an array. Identifying the basic operations and execution time of both of the algorithm was processed, while the average-case theoretical efficiency was done by thorough calculations and in-depth observations. The aforementioned algorithms were implemented in C# on a Windows environment. Number of basic operations and time to execute the algorithms, were known after taking arrays of varying lengths to account. The obtained results for both of these algorithms are compared against the theoretical predictions to understand the trend of how these algorithms operate. The functional correctness of the algorithms were also tested, while the experimental results were analyzed and graphed in Microsoft Excel. It was observed that the theoretical predictions of the basic operations and execution time for the algorithms matches with the experimental results..

 - **Basic Operations, Execution Time was measured calculated**
- **Functional correctness was tested**
